This project is made in python and only based upon the .exe format of the file.
In the model_training.py file, we trained the model with Machine Leaning model "Random Forest Classifier" on the dataset "malware_dataset".
And convert into a pickle file "model.pkl".
In the model_prediction.py file, we first extract features from a .exe file with python module "pefile".And then, we make prediction on the extracted data of the file.
With 0 as "Not Legitimate"  and 1 as "Legitimate".
